# Linear-Regression 

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. In the algorithm we aim to predict the real valued output. The hypothesis function for linear regression is given by:

Where, h is the predicted value of the output. The aim of linear regression is to choose the values of theta_0 and theta_1 such that the value of h is as close to the value of Y i.e., the actual output as possible. That means the deviation of the predicted value and the actual value must be minimal, this deviation id called Cost funtion. The cost function is given by:
